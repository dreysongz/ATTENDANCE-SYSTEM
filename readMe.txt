=======================================
PROGRESS SO FAR....
1. Sign-up form successfully captures user info and redirects them to the appropriate dashboard.
2. Login form correctly checks if user is logged in

=====================
OUTSTANDING
1. Needs to use AJAX to load validate_login.php dynamically from the server.
2. Need to remember user login by the proper use of cookies and sessions.
3. Update tab not working properly.
